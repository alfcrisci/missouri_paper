### Abstract

The predictive skill of Twitter data have been already put in evidence in different fields: business, health, market and many other. This specific feature is based on the use of volume metrics calculated on tweet counts of specific twitter stream retrieved by single/multiple query thanks to TwitterVigilance platform. Preliminary analysis and opportune metric definitions are ever required to feed useful statistical predictive  models face to the aim of sociological quantitative prediction. In this work some Twitter-based metrics have been identified and investigate in order to able reliable predictions in two different cases: (i) the number of visitors at EXPO2015, in Milan (Italy); (ii) the assessement of audience of a popular television programme (i.e., X Factor season 9 in Italy) where people are highly involved trough a  participative support of media actors by using Twitter's posts. All results provided   have been framed and validated to  obtain the maximum in terms of prediction's suitability, putting in evidence which are the best way to manage and to exploit the twitter data predictive skills. 
Concerning the attendees in a large event continuos scenario, as EXPO2015, predictive models are  based on a preliminary identication of best predictor and a similar approach is followed XF9 audience's prediction. Moreover, the paper also shows the importance of lagged twitter based metrics, intrisically taking into account with the adoption of ARIMA-ARIMAX modeling in EXPO2015 case, on the basis of data collected during the days before the event itself as in XF9 case. The positive ……….. also provides a strong correlation with the identification of the winner of the X Factor 9. All experiments reported have been based on the collected data via TwitterVigilance, a tool developed and adopted in some smart city projects and presented in this this paper.

### Attendeess prediction model EXPO2015

In this case, where the prediction of number of visitors is expected as in similar cases, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling approach including seasonality and exogenous variables (ARIMAX) are the most suitable solution to able accurate predictions. This models are included and represent an evolution of Box-Jenkins approach [Asteriou & Hall ,2011]. The autoregressive part (AR) of model creates the basis of the prediction that is improved by a moving average modeling of errors made in the previous time instants of prediction(MA). ARIMAX models for time series' prediction exploiting Twitter data as supplementary information has been proposed in several works for the prediction and in particular for flu incidence [Broniatowski et al,2015]. The use of exogenuos covariate adds respect to the simple univariate ARIMA use other relevant predictive's skill only if exist a linkage between twitter conversation and the event itself. Following this consideration the reliable covariate used, that consist in Twitter count derived time series, are individuated measuring their statistical association with the predictand by using a minimal  AIC criterion. Thanks to stepAIC() function of R MASS package the predictor's selection is carried out inside a linear regressive scheme. The predictors individuate and delivered by the linear model summary [see tab XX]  are three and named as #RaiExpo RT/T ratio,#AlbertoDellaVita RT/T ratioand #expo2015 RT/T ratio. They are derived predictors (ratio between retweet and tweets of single hashtag) and show deep association with EXPO2015 visitors and belong at same class of metrics.

Table xxxx: Diagnostic model EXPO2015 summary

 EXPO2015 work data matrix starts at 01-08-2015 and ends at 31-10-2015. The training period are individuated in the first 71 days of the series available, and test period (11-10-2015/31-27/10/2015) are the final two week period of event.The order of model and the corresponded six parameter p,d,q,P,D,Q parameters are obtained thanks to auto.arima() function of R forecast package by using the daily visitors' data. The validation's metric adopted is the root mean square error (RMSE) applied on test period's predictions and the correpondent observed data. 
The final seasonal ARIMAX model individuate, includes  weekly periodicity (p=7), and have  shown the better predictive accuracy in terms of RMSE respect to the same univariate seasonal ARIMA model that have worked without covariates. The selected linear regressive model, used in diagnosis step, doesn't show a good predictive perfomance, and in this case, can't to be used in predicitive way ( see tab XX). Formally covariates in ARIMA models, obtained from the previous the predictor's selection,have the following form: 

                                                                     (1)

The order of final ARIMAX model are indicated by the following parameter p=2,d=1,q=2 and  P=1,D=0,Q=0 for seasonal part of model. The one take form formally:
                                                                    
                                                                     (2)



Where: ,  are the autoregressive components weighting factors;  seasonal weighting factor at 7 days; ,  the moving average weighting factors;  is an independent variable with normal distribution and zero mean. Thus, by substituting (2) in (1), it is possible to obtain the equation to estimate  with respect the past measures,\beta is the vector of future exogenous covariables; 
The table of final ARIMAX Model estimates are:

ARIMA(2,1,2)(1,0,0)[7] | ar1   |     ar2 |    ma1   |     ma2 |   sar1        | RaiExpo_ratio | alberodellavita_ratio | expo2015_ratio|

Figure xxxx: …………………………….. 

The figure XXX reports the comparison among the four models used in this case and the reported time series of EXPO2015 visitors: prediction  of Linear Model ( ML  model): the univariate ARIMA (2,1,2) model without seasonality; the ARIMA(2,1,2)(1,0,0)[7] ARIMA model without covariate, and ARIMAX(2,1,2)(1,0,0)[7] with exogenous covariables. From the results reported in Table XXX, it is evident that the selected model ARIMAX(2,1,2)(1,0,0)[7]+Z is that presents the lower RMSE (root mean square error) with respect the real presences in the prediction period.

#### Case Study on X Factor 9 Italy, 2015: predicting the audience

X Factor is a well-known television music competition format born in UK and then exported abroad as to become the biggest television talent competition in Europe. In Italy in 2015 it was aired the 9th edition, XF9. The show is aired annually from September until December with first transmissions devoted to auditions and first singers selections (so called boot camps) followed by six weeks of weekly live shows where progressively less appreciated singers are eliminated except for the four best talents who reach the final, where the winner is voted by the public.
XFactor in Italy is broadcast on the pay-tv channel Sky1, but preliminary phases and the finale are aired also on free channels. The show begins at prime time and closes after mid night with Xtra Factor transmission that also attracts the same audience. Audience is typically young people also engaged on voting the singers and groups to eliminate or push them ahead. 
As for every talent competition, the participation of the public is critical for the success of XFactor show and social media play a critical role promoting singers, stimulating discussion and comments and pushing people to watch the show and vote for their favourites. Votes form the public during the XFactor finale reached 7 million, and the official hashtag #xf9 was the most widely used of the day (on the 10th December, final show day) both in Italy and in the worldwide Trending topic.The audience is typically for young people that are also engaged on voting the singers and groups to eliminate or push them ahead. The knowledge about the number of visitors, and thus of the prediction can be very important to sale the advertising delivered in the context of the television transmissions. XF9 organization has prepared a wide and effective dissemination and marketing campaign also including social media, and thus Twitter account and hashtags as the singers, and the judges, others have been produced spontaneously by the audience. 




Figure 5: Trends of twitter count for #XF9 on channel Xfactor9 on Twitter Vigilance.

XF9 channel on TwitterVigilance collected about 1.6 millions of tweets in Italian, that are mainly concentrated to the prime time and with much lower numbers in the days before the event, 435 of tweets and 57% of retweets (see Figure 5), and from XXXX unique users. The competition has led to 4 finalists in December 2015: Giosada, Urban Strangers, Davide Sciortino, Enrica Tara, and selecting the Giosada as winner. The metering of audience is typically performed by Auditel (described above) and via Smart Panel Sky. The official data can be accessed by Wikipedia: https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Factor_%28nona_edizione%29 The production of XF9 has planned an wide and effective maketing capaing, including Twitter user and hashtags as #XF9, #XTRA9 and later #xf9Live. At these, a number of hashtag has been added for the singers as: #UrbanStrangers, #comeva, #eleonora, #giosada, #Enrica, etc. But also for the judger/tutor, and for specific cases as: @DivanoRolling, #divanorolling, #GiosadaAlBallottaggio, #Elio, #elioperilsociale, etc. The trend of the other hashtags is reported in Figure 6. 







Figure 6: Trends of searches twitter volumes for the observed major hashtags on channel Xfactor9 of Twitter Vigilance.


#### Prediction XF9  audience model. 

In this case, the challenge was to predict the volume of the audience attending the TV event in the prime time one a week. the best predicitive model identification, in reason to the different time data structure and hence of predictions, may follow partially the procedure adopted for EXPO2015 case. In XF9 case it was not possible to identify valid training/test sets in reason to the low numerosity of work matrix, so the second step of ARIMA models set up is avoided and predictions were carried out by using only the best linear model obtained by predictor selection. The form is the same of equation 1.The target variable is represented by the users count declared by Sky Platform, that give the amount of device connected during the events. These data represent a good indicator of audience. The model fitting outcome is summarized by the following table and prediction/observed within interval of confidence ( 95%) are plotted in Figure 7.

Anyway results indicate a reliable perfomance of linear regressive model by using lagged twitter predictors, but inform that is the ratio between retweets and native tweets that have more predictive sense.
